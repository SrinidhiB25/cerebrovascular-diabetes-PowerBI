## Cerebromicrovascular Disease in Elderly Patients with Diabetes: A Data-Driven Healthcare Analytics Study

This project showcases an end-to-end healthcare data analytics solution built using Power BI to examine the relationship between diabetes mellitus, vascular complications, cognitive performance, and mobility outcomes. The analysis evaluates how diabetes duration, glycemic control, and diabetic retinopathy severity affect neurological and physical functioning through interactive, insight-driven dashboards.

The solution leverages Power BI data modeling, DAX measures, and advanced visualization techniques to integrate metabolic indicators (HbA1c, cholesterol, blood pressure), ophthalmological findings (retinopathy severity stages), and functional metrics (cognitive scores, gait stability). By enabling drill-down analysis and cross-filtering across clinical dimensions, the dashboards support trend identification, risk stratification, and data-driven decision-making, demonstrating practical analytics skills applicable to real-world healthcare and business intelligence use cases.
